# lead_map

:warning: *Currently under construction!*

Repository to host code and data for US and UK lead maps for the project "Mapping disparities in childhood lead exposure in England".

This repository is an upcycled version of the deprecated [leadmap_public](https://github.com/fditraglia/leadmap-public) that was decided to be overhauled in July 2023.

# Instructional Materials
We'll be doing a fair bit of spatial work and we'll also need to access UK and US census data. Here are some R packages and associated instructional materials that we should all take a look at:
- <https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html>
- <https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html>
- <https://github.com/virgesmith/UKCensusAPI>
- <https://rspatial.org/>

# Rules for collaboration
1. PRs (Pull Requests) should be small and logically contained
2. Create appropriate directories for raw data files, intermediate data files, and code to make the work as traceable as possible.
3. Tag PIs when issue/task finalized for review
