# lead_map

## Information
:warning: *Currently under construction!*

This repository is an upcycled version of the deprecated [leadmap_public](https://github.com/fditraglia/leadmap-public).

## Contents

Repository to host preprocessing code, data links, and model exploration for US and UK lead maps for the project "Mapping disparities in childhood lead exposure in England".

You can find information on particular sections in subfolder Readme.md files.

Current maintainer of this repository is [me](lasse.vonderheydt@economics.ax.co.uk)

## Modeling
For modeling, we use STAN. Head over to [learn-bayes](https://github.com/fditraglia/learn-bayes) for some examples.

## Rules for collaboration for joiners
1. PRs (Pull Requests) should be documented, small and logically contained
2. Respect the project structure, i.e. directories for raw data files, intermediate data files, and code to make the work as traceable as possible.
3. Tag PIs when issue/task finalized for review

## Instructional Materials
We'll be doing a fair bit of spatial work and we'll also need to access UK and US census data. Here are some R packages and associated instructional materials that give an intro:
