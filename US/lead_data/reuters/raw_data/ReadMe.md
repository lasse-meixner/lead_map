# Raw Files
Raw files lie in the associated Google drive directory.

The source files automatically grab them from there if run, and download them to this directory before loading into memory. Please do not commit them to the GitHuB repository.

## Authentication
When you run any of the scripts, it will automatically run code that will prompt authentication with Google Drive. Your Google account obviously needs to have access to the shared project folder, if you don't, talk to me (Lasse) or Frank. Once authenticated, you should whether you would like to locally cache your credentials. This is recommended, as it will save you from having to authenticate every time you run the scripts.
